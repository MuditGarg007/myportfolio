        <div class="project">
            <h3>Cafe Management System</h3>
            <p>For my first project, I developed a comprehensive Cafe Management System using Python and MySQL. This project aimed to streamline various aspects of cafe operations, including inventory management, order processing, and customer relationship management.</p>
            <p>The system features an intuitive user interface for cafe staff to easily input and manage inventory levels, track sales, and generate reports for informed decision-making. Additionally, it includes a customer database to store preferences and facilitate personalized service.</p>
            <p>Throughout the development process, I focused on scalability and efficiency, ensuring that the system could adapt to the dynamic nature of the hospitality industry while maintaining optimal performance.</p>

            <h3>School Management System</h3>
            <p>For my second project, I created a robust School Management System using Python and MySQL. This project was designed to streamline administrative tasks, enhance communication between stakeholders, and improve overall efficiency within educational institutions.</p>
            <p>The system incorporates modules for student enrollment, attendance tracking, grade management, and staff administration, providing administrators, teachers, and parents with a centralized platform to access pertinent information.</p>
            <p>With a focus on user experience and accessibility, I implemented features such as role-based access control and real-time notifications to ensure seamless interaction and collaboration among users.</p>
